# Better Geeklist
I enjoy looking at boardgames over on https://boardgamegeek.com, but their Geeklist sorting functionality is frankly just atrocious. Basic things like being able to sort by "Average Rating" are just missing. So I decided to make this little program to fix that.

It functions by scraping a Geeklist for data and then spits that out into an easier to use front-end.
